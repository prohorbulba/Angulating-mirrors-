# Angulating-mirrors :) 
Art-Engineering project in which many synchronized mirrors rotate/move in unison

# Servo Mirror Module

A small mirror mounted on three micro-servos.  
Servos control pitch, yaw, and angle.  
Multiple modules can run together for coordinated light movement.

## CAD & Printing

The frame and mirror mount were modeled in Blender and printed on a resin 3D printer.  
Tolerances are tight so the servos sit without too much backlash.

## Mirror Control

Three servos drive a small platform that holds the mirror.  
This gives enough range to redirect the LED light in different directions.

## Electronics

A microcontroller controls the three servos.  
The LED ribbon is right behind the mirror, using the fact that the structures resin is transparent -- thats what will make the lights visible :)
